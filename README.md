# **The Gaming Room Project**

## ***"Draw It or Lose It"***

- **Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?**

    Our client The Gaming Room wants to develop a cross-platform version of their game "Draw It or Lose It." The game is a variation of the 1980s tv game show "Win Lose or Draw." The client requested the following as part of their requirements for the application. 
    1. A game will have the ability to have one or more teams involved.
    2. Each team will have multiple players assigned to it.
    3. Game and team names must be unique to allow users to check whether a name is in use when choosing a team name.
    4. Only one instance of the game can exist in memory at any given time. This can be accomplished by creating unique identifiers for each instance of a game, team, or player.

- **What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?**

    I think that I did a good job on identifying the requirements in this document. I also provide some recommendations based on industry standards.

- **What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?**

    I found that the UML really helped me to visualize the app from a development perspective. It aloud me to plan out my development because it highlighted key components that I would need to address in order to get the data I was expecting.

- **If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**

    I think I would revisit the Evaluation section of the document. While I feel this provided a sufficient evaluation of the given technologies, I would have liked to have done some more research. Technology is constantly evolving and I would've maybe done some more in depth statistical research on the use of newer technologies and how organizations try to leverage them in a changing technological landscape.

- **How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**

    I think that as developers we like to consider ourselves to be creative problem-solvers. Often times being creative is synonymous with aesthetics but there is something to be said about logically creative solutions. We tend to think that we are problem solvers first and designers later but you don't have to be one or the other. You can choose to "design" and implement code that is logically creative.

- **How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?**

    As mentioned earlier, I really appreciated the UML diagram. In a complex project, it really takes the most difficult part of development which for me is visualization and breaks it down into more of a logical approach than something aesthetic. Without the proper logic put into place it can severely impact performance and user experience. The design "spec" is a great way to document changes throughout the development process. It is also a living document and can be revised to accommodate the application development as needed. It also, helps other developers understand the implementation process that you used in development.
